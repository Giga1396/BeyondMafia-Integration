						Based on the card game <a href="https://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/tworoomsandaboom" target="_blank">2 Rooms and a Boom</a> by Tudesday Knight Games.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						In Split Decision, all players are randomly a split among two rooms, as well as split among two teams: Red and Blue. One player is assigned the role of President, and another is the Bomber.
						The game plays over a series of rounds, and in each round each room will elect a leader. Those leaders will then meet together and choose one or more players (the hostages) to swap between the rooms for the next round.
					</div>
					<div className="paragraph">
						As the game progresses the rounds will get shorter and the number of players swapped between rooms will decrease.
						It is the goal of the Red team for the President and the Bomber to end up in the same room after the last round.
						It is the goal of the Blue team for them to end up in different rooms.
